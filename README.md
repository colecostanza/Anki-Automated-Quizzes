## Use Case's

This add-on allows you to create quizzes from Anki decks as an alternative to Quizlet's quiz function.

Great to pair with [@sviatoslav-lebediev's](https://github.com/sviatoslav-lebediev) [anki-quizlet-importer-extended](https://github.com/sviatoslav-lebediev/anki-quizlet-importer-extended) add-on to scrape decks directly from Quizlet.


## Installation

To install download the [Anki Automated Quizzes.ankiaddon]() file and either double-click the add-on or import via Tools > Add-ons > Install from file...

You may also package this add-on yourself by cloning the repository, compressing the contents to a zip, and renaming from ".zip" to ".ankiaddon". A this time I do not have an add-on code.
